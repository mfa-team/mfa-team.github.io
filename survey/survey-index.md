# A Survey on Multi-Factor Authentication for Online Banking

In our work we collected a notable amount of data regarding 30 banks, operating all over the world, investigating several details on the MFA implementation they adopted.
<br/>

 - A table reporting an **overview of the MFA solutions** adopted by each bank can be found [here](survey-table).
 - The list of the **references** and data sources is reported [in this page](sources-list).
 - The **evaluation of each (observed) MFA protocol**, in terms of resistance against a given set of attacker models and complexity is presented [here](mfa-protocols-evaluation).
 - The tables reporting the **compliance** with legal requirements (extracted from EU regulations) and best practices are available [here](requirements-evaluation) and [here](best-practices-evaluation), respectively.
