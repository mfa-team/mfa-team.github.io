**Multi-factor authentication** (mfa) is a form of digital authentication affering strong security guarantees.

MFA is based on the so-called MFA Protocols, i.e. security protocols that integrate traditional identity proofs (user credentials) with additional ones, called *authentication factors*.

Authentication factors are based on either *knowledge*, *possession* or *inherence*. 

During the execution of an MFA protocol, authentication factors are provided through specific
objects, called *authenticators*.

During the last years, MFA has been widely adopted, with a notable variety of offered MFA protocols, authenticators and authentication factors.
